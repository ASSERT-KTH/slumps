C is a double edged sword. It was designed to allow programmers to do virtually anything and everything. The aim was as a high level language to be close as possible at the computer hardware (CPU and memory). This gives the property of C to being fast. Therefore its possible to write large parts for Operating Systems with it. The ability to access memory at the bit level, embed assembly directly and yet be readable ( or unreadable ) by humans, resulted in a language which forms the foundation of the world as we know it.

In other words, there is no check. Users and programmers can do anything they want. There is no sandbox, no off-limits area. Unless it is explicitly forbidden by the compiler or the operating system, a C program without sufficient and necessary checks will result in 'unintended and unforeseen' consequences with the 'appropriate' inputs.

On the bright side, programming in C disciplines the programmer, nothing like a grueling boot camp or war time conscription to make one appreciate the niceties of a Java, Perl, Python or Haskell.

But try writing an operating system with them...

With great power, comes great responsibility. :)
