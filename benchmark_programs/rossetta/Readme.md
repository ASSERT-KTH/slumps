We crawled the C programs from Rosetta corpus: From 996 programs, we collected **991** programs ([here](https://github.com/KTH/slumps/tree/master/utils/pipeline/craw_rosetta.py) is the crawl script). We checked the syntax of the programs getting: **790** successfully checked programs and **201** invalid codes.
